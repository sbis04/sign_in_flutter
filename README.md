### **Checkout my Medium article ["Flutter: Implementing Google Sign In"](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-implementing-google-sign-in-71888bca24ed).**

In this app, I have implemented **Google Sign In** using **Firebase** for both Android and iOS, fixing all the issues with the latest Flutter updates. To understand how to fix all the **Firebase** issues in **Flutter** make sure you check out my **Medium article**.

> NOTE: The project is updated to **Flutter version 1.12**.

## Flutter 1.7 updates

With the introduction of Flutter 1.7, the most frustrating thing fixing **AndriodX incompatibilities** has been taken care of. Now, you can just create a new project using the `--androidx` flag to ensure the generated project targets the new support library.

## Firebase changes

Now, you need to fill the **OAuth consent form** in order to use **Firebase** in your app, otherwise your app will just crash. So, make sure you checkout my **Medium article**.

# Using this app
If you want to clone and use this app, then you have to complete the following steps:

### Step 1: Generate the SHA-1

Use the following command to generate **SHA-1**:

```bash
keytool -list -v \
-alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore
```

### Step 2: Complete the Firebase setup

First of all, complete the whole Firebase setup for both **Android** and **iOS**. You will get two files while doing the setup, one for each platform. You have to place the **google-services.json** & **GoogleService-Info.plist** files in the respective directory of each platform. For more info, check out my Medium article.

> NOTE: USE THE SHA-1 GENERATED FROM YOUR SYSTEM

### Step 3: Completing the iOS integration

For the iOS part, you have to do one more step. You will find a **TODO** in **Info.plist** file, just complete that.

### Step 4: Run the app

Now, you can run the app on your device using the command:

```bash
flutter run
```
